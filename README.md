# Smart-Door-Lock
With the help of Arduino Uno,PIR sensor,motor, LCD display,IC l293d, IC ULN2803 and relay, I have made a smart door lock. When there is no one near the door, it will close automatically, and when someone passes by, it will open automatically. If someone comes near the gate in the middle of the process, then the door will immediately start closing from that point only and vice versa.
